# This file is entirely maintained by NexoVolta (nx-v) for the Ruko programming
# language. If you want to contribute, please open an issue or a pull request
# on the official GitHub repository:
#
# https://github.com/nx-v/ruko
#
# Note that this grammar is still actively being developed alongside
# the compiler and spec itself, so frequent updates may be necessary.
#
# If you find any bugs or want to suggest any new features, please
# open an issue or a pull request on the repository above.

# Planned features / TODOs:
#
# - [x] Fix bugs with prefix type annotations in function parameters,
#   variable declarations, bindings, and type casts to use a recursive
#   pattern with subroutines rather than a single greedy .*+ match.
#   Uses atomic groups and recursion (?>...) and \1|'(?:\\.|[^\\'])*'|"(?:\\.|[^\\"])*" for proper nesting.
# - [ ] Rework inline Markdown syntax. Refer to Typst, Textile, Texy,
#   ASCIIDoc and other lightweight markup languages for inspiration.
#   Use "while" regex matches to avoid conflicts with existing syntax.
#   Current planned features:
#   - [x] Headings and subheadings
#   - [x] Deleted and inserted text ~~deleted~~ ++inserted++
#   - [x] Definition blocks :::
#   - [x] Superscript ^super^
#   - [x] Subscript ~sub~
#   - [x] Highlighted text ==highlight==
#   - [x] Redacted text ||redacted||
#   - [x] Block-quotes
#   - [x] Inline math $$math$$ via Typst/LaTeX hybrid syntax
#   - [x] Citations
#   - [x] Footnotes
#   - [x] Spans !!.custom.classes span!!
#   - [ ] Selectors and anchors #anchor .class
#   - [ ] Code blocks
#   - [ ] Tables | Header 1 | Header 2 |
#   - [ ] Checklists - [x] Task 1 - [ ] Task 2
#   - [x] Links and images ![alt text](url)
#   - [x] Lists (ordered and unordered)
#   - References and further reading for inline Markdown syntax:
#     https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/
#     https://typst.app/docs/reference/
#     https://texy.nette.org/en/
#     https://textile-lang.com/
# - [ ] Add more DSLs (domain-specific languages) with the %directive syntax.
# - [ ] Add standard library based on the JavaScript, Node and Deno
#   standard libraries, based on this link.
#   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
#   https://nodejs.org/api/
#   https://deno.land/std@0.224.0
#   More libraries will be added later on, drawing from popular JavaScript
#   frameworks and libraries when appropriate.
# - [ ] Add inline assembly syntax for WebAssembly with a syntax similar to
#   Rust's asm! macro and Solidity's inline assembly.
#   https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/arch/wasm32/asm/index.html
# - More patterns should have `applyEndPatternLast: true` where appropriate
#   to make patterns more modular and easier to maintain, rather than
#   having everything in one big pattern.
# - Add more tests for all patterns to ensure they work as intended.
# - Duplicate patterns using the alias/merge feature in YAML (&,*,<<)
#   to reduce redundancy and make maintenance easier.
#   - Each section in the grammar has a built-in repository for this purpose.
# - All patterns should have better comments explaining what they do.
# - Add support for s-expressions (Lisp-style syntax) as an alternative
#   syntax for function calls and expressions. This will require a massive
#   refactor of the grammar to implement properly.
# - Add full support for significant whitespace (like Python, Haskell, etc.)
#   as an alternative to curly braces for blocks. A massive refactor will
#   be needed to implement this properly.
# - Add support for reflection and meta-programming syntax, used for
#   compile-time code generation, type introspection, etc. on the level
#   of the language itself rather than relying on external tools.
#   Refer to the "Safe C++" and "Reflection" propsals for the C++26 standard
#   for inspiration.
#   https://safecpp.org/draft.html
#   https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2996r0.html
# - [ ] Plan and implement all the built-in modules, classes, objects, constants
#   functions and properties for Ruko's standard library.
#   This would all be done in a separate PR and once the grammar is completely
#   finished.
# - [ ] Multi-base numeric literals (up to base 64). Digits will be \d, a-z,
#   lowercase Icelandic thorn, lowercase eth, A-Z, uppercase Icelandic thorn.
# - [ ] Add new parameter binding/destructuring syntax for:
#   - [ ] Strings (yes, strings are meant to be destructured)
#   - [ ] Regular expressions (yes, regex captures should be destructured)
#   - [ ] Arrays
#   - [ ] Sets
#   - [ ] Maps and objects
#   - [ ] Tuples
#   - [ ] Function arguments
#   - [ ] Variables
# - [x] Fix and expand regex syntax and highlighting:
#   - [x] Add support for fuzzy matching (edits, insertions, deletions, etc.)
#   - [x] Improve highlighting for regexes with flags
#   - [x] Add and expand quantifiers and range highlighting

# Notable changes since initial release:
#
# - Added C-style prefix modifier/type annotations for declarations, bindings and casts.
#   Now, both C and Rust-style annotations can be used interchangeably, and should
#   work in simple cases. It is not recommended to nest brackets in prefix annotations
#   like ((((((((((((((((type))))))))))))))))), since this can lead to bugs that
#   break syntax highlighting due to the greedy nature of the current implementation.
# - Add \* *\ and \\ syntax for Markdown literals.
# - Add ternary, senary and duodecimal bases for numeric literals.
# - Reworked escape sequences for UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and all numeric bases.
# - Add regexp patterns for Unicode character properties, scripts, blocks,
#   categories, etc. Refer to: https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/
# - Reworked number syntax highighting to be more consistent and stricter.
# - Added support for splicing syntax <[ ]> / <{ }> to embed expressions OR
#   statements, respectively, inside JSX/XML tags.
# - Refactored identifier syntax to accept a single backtick (`) at the start
#   of an identifier to allow for reserved keywords to be used as identifiers.
#   For example: `if`, `while`, `func`, etc. A similar way to strop keywords
#   is to append an underscore OR a CGJ (U+034F) character.
# - Refactored and improved syntax highlighting for operators.
#   - Infix operators at the end of lines continue to the next line.
#   - Interfix operators (without spaces on both sides) have a higher precedence
#     than normal infix operators (with spaces on both sides).
#   - Fixed function call syntax around operators. Anchors include open brackets,
#     commas, semicolons, colons, newlines, and spaces, regardless of whether
#     they are surrounded by prefix or suffix operators.
#   - Fixed prefix and suffix operators beside function calls.
#   - Removed ternary operators (?: and ?:) in favor of a more consistent
#     syntax using if-then-else expressions.
# - Added infix function call syntax using backslashes, similar to Haskell's
#   backtick function call syntax.
#   For example: a \x\ b is equivalent to x(a, b).
#   This now means that operators CANNOT start or end with a backslash,
#   and backslashes cannot be used prefix or postfix,
#   same with angle brackets, pipes, and forward slashes,
#   which are used for JSX/generics, lambdas and regexes respectively.
# - Brought back Haskell-style function call syntax with
#   space OR comma-separated arguments.
#     funcName arg1 arg2 { arg3: 10 }; or
#     funcName arg1, arg2, { arg3: 10 }
#   This CANNOT be mixed and matched with normal function call syntax.
#   Use either one or the other consistently.
#     funcName(arg1, arg2, { arg3: 10 })
#   Named arguments are supported only in the latter syntax.
#   All arguments after the first named argument MUST be named as well.
#     funcName(arg1: 10, &mut arg2, stat const arg3: { k: v } as MyType)
# - Add operator definition syntax for user-defined operators.
#   oper param <suffix>: return_type { ... }
#   oper <prefix> param: return_type { ... }
#   oper param1 <infix> param2: return_type { ... }
#   oper param1 <ternary_1> param2 <ternary_2> param3: return_type { ... }
#   Example: oper x ** y -> f64 = pow(x, y)
# - Added Python slicing syntax for arrays, strings, tuples, etc.:
#   array[start:end:step]
#   string[start:end:step]
#   tuple[start:end:step]
#   Negative indices and arbitrary expressions are supported.
# - Added C(++) directives: #include, #define, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else,
#   #elif, #endif, #pragma, #region, #endregion, #once, #error, #warning.
#   These can be placed anywhere in the code, and will be processed before compilation.
#   A change to #define directives is that they can support regex
#   replacements as well as normal text replacements. This is dangerous,
#   so use with caution.
# - Added new keywords: expr, eval, init (C++ static init) and comp (Zig comptime).
# - Overall syntax has been reworked to be terser and more consistent.
#   Inspired by Rust, Zig, Flix, Jai, Odin, D, Reason and Motoko.
# - Import/export/module syntax inspired by JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust and Python:
#   - glob file path matching: import path/**/*.ruko
#   - named imports/exports: import module{a,b,c}
#   - default imports/exports: import module)
#   - renaming imports/exports: import module{a:x,b:y}
#   - show/hide mechanism: import module{a,b-c,d}
#   - glob-style pattern matching: import module{a*,b?,c{1,2}}
# - Fixed many JSX/XML bugs with tags and attributes:
#   - Fixed attributes not highlighting properly in self-closing tags.
#     <MyComponent prop="value" />
#   - Fixed attributes with no values not highlighting properly.
#     <MyComponent disabled />
#   - Fixed nested tags not highlighting properly.
#     <Parent><Child></Child></Parent>
#   - Fixed the final '>' in an implicit closing tag '</>' not being highlighted properly.
#     <MyComponent></> now highlights the final > properly.
#   - Fixed comments within tags not highlighting properly.
#   - __New inline Markdown-like syntax:__
#     - **bold** __bold__
#     - _italic_ *italic*
#     - ~~deleted~~ ++inserted++
#     - ==highlighted==
#     - ||redacted||
#     - ^superscript^
#     - ~subscript~
#     - ``code``
#     - imported links: [text](url)
#   - A line starting with '>' starts a code block until the end of the line.  Use
#     brackets, braces or strings to span multiple lines.
#     <div>
#       > let x = 10
#       Normal text here.
#     </>
#   - Same for headings, which start with '# ## ### #### ##### ######' etc.
#     <div>
#       ### This is a heading
#       > let y = 20
#       More normal text.
#     </>
#   - Block-quotes now start with '*' rather than '>', to avoid conflicts with code blocks.
#     <div>
#       * This is a block-quote.
#         It can span multiple lines.
#     </>
#   - '+' and '-' indicate ordered and unordered list items respectively.
#     <div>
#       + Item 1
#       + Item 2
#         - Subitem "2.1"
#         - Subitem "2.2"
#       + Item 3
#     </>
#   Add dynamic JSX/XML literals where <(expr)/> evaluates to an `elem`.
# - Fix bug with highlighting of generics when followed by
#   ! or ~ macro/destructor calls. For example: Vec<int>!(), MyType~().
# - Brought back train-case for CSS properties and HTML attributes.
#   For example: background-color, font-size, border-radius, my-component, etc.
# - Added x->y syntax for C++-style pointer dereferencing.
#   object->method(arg1, arg2)
#   object->property
# - Custom modifiers can now be placed before any declaration or binding, including
#   in lambda functions, for example: async inplace func sort(x: []int) { ... }
#   This includes within map declarations and function parameters, though the
#   contextual keyword 'fn' is required in order to use those modifiers.
# - Reworked function parameter binding/destructuring syntax. For example:
#   func f(const (a, b), let {c, d}, mut [e, f], dyn g) { ... }
# - Function calls are highlighted more consistently, triggering beside ( and { only,
#   and in s-expressions right after an opening (. When a function call is assigned
#   to a variable, or used in an expression, the call is highlighted more consistently
#   and the function call must be bracketed.
# - Added Objective C-style method call syntax using square brackets:
#   [object method: arg1, arg2]. Note that the colon (:) is required after
#   each method name.
# - Added keywords temp, prop, actor, realm, style, script, intern, extern,
#   assert, check, given, using, state, decl, and debug.
#   These are used for various purposes such as temporary variables, properties,
#   actors (concurrency), realms (namespaces), styles (CSS), scripts (JS),
#   internal/external linkage, assertions, context parameters, state variables,
#   declarations, and debugging.
# - Fixed empty generics: T<> is now highlighted properly in calls and annotations.
#   Fixed generics before curly braces. T<C> { x } does not trigger another type
#   annotation and highlights a regular block.
# - Added syntax for macro `x!()` and destructor `x~()` calls. These are placed
#   after the generics if any. For example: Vec<int>!(), MyType~().
# - Fixed style k-v pairs in style blocks which highlight until a semicolon, comma
#   or closing brace.
# - All control structures do not need to be bracketed. If the body of a
#   control structure is a single statement, the braces can be omitted,
#   and is replaced by a colon (:). This includes if, for, while, switch,
#   match, try, catch, etc.
# - Fixed syntax highlighting of code blocks beside lambda pipes.
# - Added numeric literals for all bases from 2 to 16, including special digits
#   for base 12 (including Unicode Turned 2 and Turned 3 for digits 10 and 11).
#   Base 12 (0z, \z in strings and character classes) uses digits \d,
#   A, X, T, or turned 2 for digit 10, and B, E or turned 3 for digit 11.
# - Numbers and escape sequences have been reworked, and will no longer accept
#   invalid digits for their respective bases beyond 0x10FFFF, or decimal 1114111.
# - Most keywords should have a max of 6 characters. Longer keywords have been
#   shortened or removed. For example, 'function' is 'func', 'property' is 'prop',
#   'template' is 'temp', 'iterator' is 'iter', etc.
# - Range keywords to, till and by have been removed in favor of Swift-like
#   range operators '>..', '...', '..<' and '>.<', and the step operator '..''.
# - Generics now capture properly before and after function and type names.
#   For example, T.<x>, T?.<x>, T!.<x>, T::<x>, T?:<x>, T!:<x>.
#   They can even be curried: x<T><U>(y), x<T><U><V>(y).
# - Generic type parameters now work for prefix operators as well. "i.e". T<&x>, etc.
# - Fixed a bug where escape sequences for literals would accept integers bigger than
#   decimal 1114111 which now are highlighted as an error.
# - Bases 4 and 6 have been removed, though a multi-base (up to base 64)
#   numeric literal is still in the works.
# - Interpolation and formatting syntax have been reworked and fixed, and can now
#   span multiple lines and beyond 20 nested layers thanks to applyEndPatternLast.
#   Because of this, spacing around most of the patterns here have also been removed;
#   a separate 'space' scope is added to join everything together.
# - Fixed some bugs with regular expressions:
#   - Added and expanded quantifiers and range highlighting
#   - Add support for fuzzy matching (edits, insertions, deletions, etc.)
#   - Improved highlighting for regexes with flags
# - Added prefixes to strings, with those prefixes being the symbols used to
#   enable those features.
#   - Prefix \ makes a string raw (i.e. no escape sequences),
#   - Prefix % makes a string formatted (i.e. with interpolation and format specifiers),
#   - Prefix $ allows interpolation without formatting (i.e. simple variable/expression
#     substitution).
#   - Prefix # makes a string a #template string, which supports all features
#     and is used specifically to mark arguments inside template strings.
#   These prefixes can be combined in any order, including multiple times.
#   These will be added to regular expressions later on.
# - Added Python negation syntax: is not, if not, not in, not of.
#   - Removed unless/until keywords. Replaced by if!/if not and while!/while not.
# - Switched around regular expressions and unquoted strings:
#   / triggers a regex when it begins an expression. ` is now used to begin
#   unquoted strings.
# - Two (or more) regular expressions in a row on the same line without a comma
#   triggers a replacement string instead of a normal regular expression literal.
# - Changed up syntax highlighting of switch and match statements to be more
#   consistent with JavaScript.
# - Function calls now trigger beside '(' and '{'.
# - Fixed module syntax to be more consistent with JavaScript.
# - Dashes will no longer be allowed in identifiers. Use underscores instead.
# - Fixed XML highlighting and attributes, inspired by Svelte, Angular (TS), HAML
#   - @directive
#   - #id and .class
#   - :event and |pipe (both from Svelte)
#   - %directive
#   - &reference and *spread
#   - ?boolean and @property (from Lit)
# - Added script blocks for injection of raw JS, C++, Rust, Zig, etc.
#   If no language is specified, C++ is assumed, because of Ruko's compiler target.
# - Fixed keys in literal objects. They will now highlight until a colon, comma
#   or closing brace.
# - Fixed modifier keywords beside lambda functions. Modifiers can now be placed
#   before lambda functions in addition to normal function declarations.
# - Fixed default values in function arguments, thus no longer requiring trailing
#   commas. 'from' and 'where' statements, the string `\| and the operator | have to
#   be bracketed.
# - Slightly changed attribute selectors to allow for regexp matches.
