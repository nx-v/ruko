/*
help me translate this yaml file (plus the build script) into the shiki version, which uss the js regex dialect, as accurately as possible. 

what i mean by that is that this does not import anything from the yaml file, but be a separate version for use in shiki. that means the final grammar should start with export default { } and inside should contain the regular expressoins

i made a separate ruko.tmlanguage.js file

you are allowed to dynamically create regexes since this is a javascrpit file.
