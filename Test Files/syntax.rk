\\ Ruko is a markup, scripting, styling and shader language that compiles
\\ to HTML/CSS/JS, WebAssembly, and WebGPU shaders (GLSL, WGSL, etc.).
\\ Its syntax is inspired by Haskell, Rust and Kotlin, hence the name
\\ "HaRuKo", clipped to just "Ruko", but also is named after the character
\\ Haruko Haruhara from the anime "FLCL".

\\ This language is both a personal project and a learning experiment
\\ for me to practice language and compiler design, and to make my own
\\ engine, LSP and IDE support for it as I build it out. It's also a
\\ playground for me to explore new language features and paradigms,
\\ and to have fun with programming in general.

\\ This document is intended to be a comprehensive overview of the syntax
\\ of the Ruko language, covering all the constructs and features as provided
\\ by the compiler. Take this as a reference for how to write Ruko code,
\\ and as a guide for what the language can do. It is not intended to be a
\\ tutorial or a style guide, but rather a specification of the syntax
\\ and semantics of the language, with examples to illustrate the concepts,
\\ based on the current state of ruko.tmLanguage.yaml and the example code
\\ in the Tests/ directory. This is a living document that will be updated
\\ as the language evolves and new features are added, so check back often
\\ for the latest information on how to write Ruko code.

\\ A documentation of the standard library and built-in functions will be
\\ provided separately, as that is a different scope of work. This document
\\ will focus on the syntax of the language itself, and not on the libraries
\\ or APIs that are available to use with it.
