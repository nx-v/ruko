   01 — IGNORED / ILLEGAL PATTERNS
   Corresponds to: ruko.tmLanguage.yaml lines 328–351
   These are patterns that are silently ignored by the parser
   but flagged as errors or warnings by the editor/linter.
   ============================================================ *\

// The parser is lenient; the editor marks these as errors.

// Stray characters inside expressions that cannot start any
// known token are tagged as `invalid.illegal.ruko`.
// Examples (do not use in real code):

// @   — bare sigil with nothing following
// #   — bare hash with nothing following
// %   — bare percent with no known literal prefix
// `   — unclosed backtick identifier

// In well-formed code these tokens appear only as prefixes,
// so the "illegal" rule acts as a catch-all fallback.

// Embedded whitespace tokens are tagged `invalid.whitespace`
// when they appear inside a token that does not allow them.

// Null bytes (\x00) inside source text are always illegal.
